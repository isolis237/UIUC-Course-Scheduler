<b> Description: </b> 
Course Scheduling application where course data is fetched through customized api and the data is processed and filtered by the user through the interactive front end.

This was a semester long group project with a frontend and backend team, and met our MVP with other additional features in development.

<b> TODO </b>
- Show alternative course offering times when clicking and holding a course to enable a drag and drop feature onto the scheduler
